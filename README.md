# Social-Network-API

## Description       
This is a Social Network API made by Hiu Sum Jaime Yue.         
In this Social Network API, it allows you to read, create, update and delete data of User and Thought.         
When you run this Social Network API, you can open the API GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes 
of User and Thought. Thoughts and friends are also included in User model. Thought model includes its reaction of users.     

The technologies I used in this project are Express.js, Mongoose and NoSQL.
